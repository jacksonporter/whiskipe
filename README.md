# Whiskipe
This is the repo for developing our own Android Application in the Mobile Application Development Course at Snow College (SE-3630): Whiskipe.
## Created by Dallin Shields, Katelyn Peterson and Jackson Porter. 

The Whiskipe (/(h)wiskəˌpē/) mobile kitchen application provides a kitchen management solution for the busy or budget-conscious individual, from the stay at home parent to the dorm stricken college student. It will simplify life and shorten the time spent in the kitchen cooking or trying to find something to make. The Whiskipe will:

Keep an inventory of your kitchen that will automatically update when you make a recipe.
* Allow you to easily add items to your inventory with our in-app processor and view each item with a customized filter.
* Provide filters for you to narrow down recipes by time, name, category, and more.
* Allow you to input your own recipes, browse saved recipes, and share them easily.
* Suggests recipes by the ingredients you have on hand and the time frame you specify.
